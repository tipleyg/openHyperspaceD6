# openHyperspaceD6

openHyperspace is a single-player, multi-user dungeon-like (or MUD-like). 

## System Requirements and Technical Stack
- **Platform Neutral**. The game use .NET 10 to deliver a text-forward experience through a desktop app.
- **.NET 10+ Based**. The dotnet is prebundled with is required to build and/or run the app. A precompiled version is in the /terminalHyperspace/bin/Release/net10.0
- **Avalonia UI** Uses the Avalonia UI framework, which is licensed under the MIT License Framework. See ![AvaloniaUI.net](https://avaloniaui.net/) for details

## Current Features
- **Conflict resolution** using D6 + pip pools, i.e. 1D, 1D+1, 1D+2, 2D, etc.
- **Attribute and Skill systems**, including Skill checks based on select locations or talk with NPCs, themed and flavored.
- **Inventory** including consumables, items, and armors.
- **Combat and Non-Combat Encounters** in land and space
- **Locations** with random encounter tables and percentile odds of encounter
- **Vendors** for both equipment and vehicles, with the ability to sell at a percentile of the original value based on Persuade Skill
- **Save and Load system** using TXT files stored as .SAV extension 
- **Vehicles** including land and space vehicles
- **Hyperspace** Jump to systems, using a numerical menu, sorted by Territory and Sector
- **Mission and Journal System** These are longer than combat encounters and skill checks, involving moving to another location (or "room" in MUD terminology). There are four flavors for now: delivery, sabotage, recon, and escort missions. As these are longer missions, there are higher credits on completion.
- **Map** Automapper keeps track of Locations you've visited and connected Locations you've explored. Other sites on each planet are available in a "Disconnected Rooms" list below the automapper -- along with up or down vertical locations for entering orbit from docking bays or enter underworld locations. The map uses a canvas overlay instead of ASCII art. It's easier to read this way.
- **Command Panel** In addition to entering text commands, users can now use the command panel to enter Commands to the parser. You can quickly view all commands from a scrollable, stacked list.

## Work in Progress
- Expand introductory desert world. Lot of sand everywhere while it's under construction. Use a model for additional worlds.
- Theming. Many defaults
